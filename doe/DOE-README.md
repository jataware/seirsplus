Acknowledgments
The full designs for up to 22 factors are from Tom Cioppa's 2002 PhD dissertation (2002).  For ease of application, we use a slightly different column order for designs with fewer factors.  The 29-factor design was provided by Andy Hernandez.  For more details about the properties or application of these designs, see
